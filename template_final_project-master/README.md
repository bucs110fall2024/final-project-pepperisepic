## GUI Design
IDEA 1: -The playable character will be an antelope (impala).
^The user will be able to chose whether to play as a female or male impala. (thoughtful to user, what they prefer?)
- The background will resemble a savannah
-The obstacles that the player msut avoid are rocks
-The "predator" that is trailing the player is a leopard

IDEA 2: -The playable character will be a bird (crane) or may just do a seagull?
^ Fish will spawn in on the screen randomly (in the ocean)
- The background will show some land, with the sky and ocean
-Score will be at top of screen

### Classes

- << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description >>
IDEA 1:
-player
-user will chose to play as a female or male impala
-Leopard  (I may discard the leopard.  I am not sure how I would have it chase the impala (because i imagine the impala would essentially be stationary and its just trying to jump over the rocks going towards it?) 
-Obstacles (rocks moving on the screen)
-Score (score will change as the game lasts longer)
-Ground (character is running on ground)
IDEA 2:
-player
^user will play as a moveable crane or seagull (still deciding)
-Fish 
^fish will spawn in on screen randomly
-Score
^score will change as # of fish are caught and as game lasts longer
